# Instructions

## Step 1
Slide two bearings onto each of the four posts on the bottom plate.

## Step 2
Apply a little bit of super glue to the bearing stoppers and attach them to the tops of the bearing holders to prevent the bearings from sliding out if the robot is turned upside down.

## Step 3
Screw the aluminum mounting blocks onto the motors using two M3 30mm screws and two M3 hex nuts. Repeat this twice.

## Step 4
Attach both motors onto the bottom plate using four M3 10mm screws. 

## Step 5
Screw the ball caster into the bottom plate using the nuts/bolts that came with it, then slide the metal ball into the caster.

## Step 6
Screw the Ping ultrasonic sensor into the first mount using two M3 14mm screws with two separation pillars and two M3 hex nuts.

## Step 7
Attach that assembly to the bottom plate using two M3 10mm screws and two M3 hex nuts. 

## Step 8
Screw the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor into the second mount using four M1.6 8mm screws and four M1.6 nuts.

## Step 9
Attach that assembly to the top plate using two M3 10mm screws and two M3 hex nuts. 

## Step 10
Screw the battery pack into the top plate using two M3 12mm screws and two M3 hex nuts. 

## Step 11
Screw the Arduino Uno to the top plate using three M3 14mm screws with three separation pillars and three M3 hex nuts.

## Step 12
Attach the MPU to the shield, then screw it in place using the M3 5mm countersunk screws and M3 11mm copper pillar.

## Step 13
Attach the shield to Arduino by sliding it on.

## Step 14
Screw the M3 40mm spacers to the bottom plate using four M3 10mm screws.

## Step 15
Attach the top plate to the tops of the spacers using four M3 10mm screws.

## Step 16
Connect all of the wires according to the `Shield` column in the [parts list](partsList.md).
